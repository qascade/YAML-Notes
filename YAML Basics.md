## What is a YAML file? 
Earlier it was called `YET Another Markup Language` . Now its called `YAML aint Markup Language`. 

Note: What is a *Markup Language* ?
	-  Parent-Child relationship between components. 
	- Now this is not a programming language.
	- It is essentially a `data format language`.  
	- This is simple language to store and exchange/share data. 
	- Similar to `XML`and `JSON`Data Types

In `YAML`, you can only store data and cannot store commands. 
This is known as `Data Serialization`. Let's think about the data stored inside the `YAML` file later. 

### Data Serialization Languages
Idea is to store the data inside a Universal Format that can be shared anywhere. 

`Object` : Combination Code and Data. 

`Serialization`: Process of converting the data objects into complex data structures. (Stream of bytes) . We can store this stream of bytes into memory, Databases, etc. 

`DeSerialization`: Process of converting Stream of bytes back to data objects. 

#### Examples of Data Serialization Languages: 
- YAML
- JSON
- XML

### Why YAML is not a Markup Language now? 
Markup Languages were used to store documents. But YAML can store data.
